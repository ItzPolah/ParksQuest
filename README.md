What is Parks Quest?

- Human NPCs (ArmorStands) will be used as the main vehicles for quest dissemination/completion, similar in function to current on-market MMOs. Some NPCs will only be visible to players who have completed necessary objectives/reached certain levels. 
- Quests, you the user will be given a quest to finish and will be rewarded XP after it is finished
